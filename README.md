## Binary Inverted Index ##
Boolean model of information retrieval is a classical model in Information Retrieval. Inverted
Index is a formal representation used for this model. For larger corpora documents are usually
indexed by inverted index.

## Term Weighting Vector Space Model ##
* Term Weighting
  * TF-IDF is used to weights the terms present in the corpus
* VSM
  * VSM is used to represent the corpus in terms of vector in n-dimensional space.
* Similarity Score
  * Cosine Similarity, Euclidean distance, etc., can be used to calculate similarity score between query terms and the documents' terms.
  
 ## Best Match Models ##
 Best Match model is mostly used models in Information Retrieval Systems.
 * BM1
 * BM11
 * BM15
 * BM25 (Okapi model)
